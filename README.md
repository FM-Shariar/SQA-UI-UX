Description:
The Hatibandha Blood Donation Organization (HBDO) system allows users to register and manage donor profiles with essential details like blood group and location. They can search for donors using filters, request blood through a structured form and add donation history with proof. Users can also view past donations, update their profiles, change passwords, and submit reviews to support community feedback.
